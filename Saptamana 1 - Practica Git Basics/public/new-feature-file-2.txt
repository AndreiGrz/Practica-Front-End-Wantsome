A branch (UK: /'br??nt?/ or UK: /'brænt?/, US: /'brænt?/) or tree branch (sometimes referred to in botany as a ramus) is a woody structural member connected to but not part of the central trunk of a tree (or sometimes a shrub). Large branches are known as boughs and small branches are known as twigs.[1] The term "twig" often refers to a terminus, while "bough" refers only to branches coming directly from the trunk.
